# How do different communication strategies in prey affect their population curves?

*An investigatation on how different communication strategies impact the simulated populations of predators and prey*

This research was part of the COMP3004 Designing Intelligent Agents module during my 3rd year at UoN. It uses a number of different communication strategies from global blackboard systems to localised signalling to investigate how prey can work together to have increased survival against predators.

Once the module has wrapped up and the grades are back I will include a link to the paper.
